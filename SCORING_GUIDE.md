## 🥊 STRIKING EVENTS (50% Weight)

### Damage Events

| Event | Tier | Base Value | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Knockdown (KD)** | Near-Finish | 1.00 | Most impactful - near stoppage |
| **Knockdown (KD)** | Hard | 0.70 | Significant damage, clear knockdown |
| **Knockdown (KD)** | Flash | 0.40 | Brief knockdown, quick recovery |
| **Rocked/Stunned** | - | 0.30 | Visible damage, wobbled |

### Significant Strikes (Clean, Powerful Shots)

| Strike Type | Significant | Non-Significant |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Cross** | 0.14 | 0.07 |
| **Hook** | 0.14 | 0.07 |
| **Uppercut** | 0.14 | 0.07 |
| **Elbow** | 0.14 | 0.07 |
| **Jab** | 0.10 | 0.05 |
| **Knee** | 0.10 | 0.05 |

**Volume Dampening:**
- After +20 non-significant strike advantage, excess strikes count at only 70%
- Prevents point-fighting from dominating without damage

## 📊 10-POINT MUST SYSTEM MAPPING

### Score Ranges

| Score Card | Score Differential | Requirements |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **10-10 (Draw)** | ≤ 3.0 | Virtually identical performance |
| **10-9 (Clear Win)** | 3.0 - 140.0 | Clear winner, normal round |
| **10-8 (Dominant)** | 140.0 - 200.0 | **+ 2 KDs OR 100+ strike differential** |
| **10-7 (Near Finish)** | 250.0+ | **+ 2 KDs OR 100+ strike differential** |

### 🚨 CRITICAL GUARDRAILS FOR 10-8/10-7

To award a **10-8** or **10-7** round, ONE of these MUST be true:
- ✅ **2 or more knockdown advantage** over opponent
- ✅ **100+ total strike differential** (all strikes counted)

**Without meeting guardrails, maximum score is 10-9 regardless of point differential.**

---

## 🛡️ UNIFIED RULES GUARDRAILS

These override normal scoring in specific scenarios:

### 1. Near-Finish Dominance
- Fighter with near-finish KD or submission automatically wins round (minimum 10-9)
- Opponent cannot win unless they also have near-finish moments

### 2. Striking Dominance Override
- 20+ point striking margin overrides other factors
- Exception: Opponent has near-finish grappling

---

## 📝 SCORING EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Dominant Striking Round (10-9)
**Fighter A:**
- 2 Significant Crosses = 0.28
- 3 Significant Hooks = 0.42
- 1 Rocked opponent = 0.30
- 15 Jabs (10 sig, 5 non-sig) = 1.25
- **Total striking raw: ~2.25**

**Fighter B:**
- 5 Jabs (3 sig, 2 non-sig) = 0.40
- 1 Significant Cross = 0.14
- **Total striking raw: ~0.54**

**Result:** Fighter A wins clearly with ~1.71 difference → **10-9**
*(No 10-8 because less than 2 KDs and less than 100 strike differential)*

---

### Example 2: Knockdown Heavy Round (10-8)
**Fighter A:**
- 2 Hard Knockdowns = 1.40 ⚡
- 10 Significant strikes = 1.20
- **Total: ~2.60, with 2 KD advantage**

**Fighter B:**
- 8 Significant strikes = 0.96
- **Total: ~0.96**

**Result:** Fighter A dominates → **10-8**
*(Guardrails met: 2 KD advantage ✓)*

---

### Example 3: Volume Striking (10-8)
**Fighter A:**
- 150 total strikes landed (mix of significant and non-significant)
- **Total striking raw: ~15.0**

**Fighter B:**
- 40 total strikes landed
- **Total striking raw: ~4.0**

**Result:** Fighter A dominates → **10-8**
*(Guardrails met: 110 strike differential ✓)*

---

### Example 4: Grappling Control (10-9 - NO 10-8)
**Fighter A:**
- 2 Minutes Back Control = 0.012 × 120 = 1.44
- 1 Deep Submission = 0.60
- 2 Takedowns = 0.50
- 25 ground strikes = 2.50
- **Total grappling raw: ~5.04**

**Fighter B:**
- 10 strikes from bottom = 1.00
- 1 Takedown Stuffed = 0.04
- **Total: ~1.04**

**Result:** Fighter A dominates → **10-9 ONLY**
*(Guardrails NOT met: No 2+ KD advantage, less than 100 strike differential)*

---

## 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Damage > Volume:** One Near-Finish KD (1.00) = Ten Significant Crosses (1.40)
2. **10-8 is RARE:** Need 2+ KDs or 100+ strike difference, not just dominance
3. **Balance Matters:** 50/40/10 split means striking slightly favored but grappling still very important
4. **Control Adds Up:** 3 minutes of back control (2.16 points) = 3 Hard Knockdowns (2.10 points)
5. **Quality > Quantity:** Significant strikes worth 2x non-significant strikes
6. **Near-Finish Moments:** Always win rounds unless opponent has them too
