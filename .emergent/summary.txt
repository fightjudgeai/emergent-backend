<analysis>
The trajectory documents an explosive, iterative development cycle where an AI engineer transformed a minimal viable product (MVP) for combat sports judging into a sprawling, enterprise-grade platform named Fight Judge AI Pro Operator Suite (FJAIPOS). The development was driven by a series of increasingly ambitious feature requests from the user.

The process was highly methodical. For nearly every new feature, the AI engineer followed a strict pattern: create a new, self-contained microservice-style directory in the FastAPI backend, populate it with , an  for business logic, and  for API endpoints. This new service would then be integrated into the main  file, its startup logged, and a corresponding test file created.

This pattern was repeated relentlessly, leading to the creation of over 25 distinct backend services, covering everything from core AI scoring and event harmonization to elite features like blockchain auditing, fighter analytics, broadcast control, and professional-grade computer vision analysis. The AI also handled frontend integrations, primarily enhancing a monitoring dashboard to display data from new backend services via WebSockets. The most recent task was building a real-time CV processing framework, which was started but not completed.

The user's primary language is English. All future responses should be in English.

<product_requirements>
The application, Fight Judge AI Pro Operator Suite (FJAIPOS), is an all-encompassing, real-time platform for professional combat sports analytics, judging, and broadcasting. Originally an MVP, it has evolved into an enterprise system with over 25 interconnected microservices.

**Core Functionality:**
*   **AI-Assisted Scoring:** A sophisticated system fuses computer vision (CV) data and manual judge inputs, using a weighted scoring engine, event harmonization, and normalization to produce accurate results.
*   **Production & Operations:** Includes services for time synchronization (), round validation, automated report generation, video highlights, and data storage management.
*   **Advanced Analytics:** Features a professional-grade CV analytics engine for strike classification, power estimation, and ground-game analysis, plus a historical fighter database for trend analysis.
*   **Enterprise-Grade Features:** Role-based access control (RBAC), tamper-proof blockchain auditing, a failover engine, and a heartbeat monitor for system-wide health tracking.
*   **Broadcasting & Social Media:** Provides tools for multi-camera management, graphics overlays, sponsor logo injection, and automated social media posting (Twitter/Instagram).
*   **Configuration & Customization:** A calibration API allows for tuning AI model thresholds, and a theming engine enables custom branding.

The system is designed for live, professional events, emphasizing data integrity, low latency, and resilience.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure with a React frontend and a large-scale, modular FastAPI backend. The backend's architecture is the most notable aspect, having grown from a single server file to a collection of over 25 distinct service modules.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files & Modules:**

- ****
    - **Importance:** This is the central nervous system of the backend. It initializes the FastAPI app and is responsible for importing and including the API routers from all 25+ service modules.
    - **Changes:** This file grew massively throughout the project. Every time a new service (e.g., , ) was created, its router was imported and integrated here. It also contains startup/shutdown events for initializing services like Postgres and Redis.

- ** (e.g., , , )**
    - **Importance:** Each directory represents a distinct, self-contained microservice, following a consistent pattern. This modularity is the core architectural decision that allowed for rapid, organized expansion.
    - **Changes:** These directories were created throughout the development lifecycle. A typical module contains  (Pydantic schemas),  or  (business logic), and  (FastAPI endpoints). This pattern was repeated for every new feature.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The primary UI for displaying real-time system health and performance data.
    - **Changes:** This component was significantly enhanced multiple times. It was updated to connect to WebSockets from the  and  to display live performance metrics and service health status in dedicated UI sections.

- ****
    - **Importance:** This directory contains the test suites for all backend functionality, crucial for maintaining stability in a rapidly growing system.
    - **Changes:** New test files like  and  were created in tandem with their corresponding services to ensure each new piece of functionality was validated.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the  service by creating the API routes () and integrating it into .
- Implement the data collection system to pull datasets from sources like GitHub and Kaggle for training the CV AI models.
- Create a comprehensive test suite for the new  service and data collection pipeline.
- Test the entire system (frontend and backend) after the new features are integrated.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was in the initial stages of building a professional-grade, real-time computer vision system, as requested by the user. The goal was to create a framework for live video frame analysis to automatically detect strikes, takedowns, and submissions, and to build a system for collecting training data from public datasets.

The engineer had just started implementing the  service, following the established architectural pattern. The work concluded immediately after the successful creation of the initial files for this new module:

-   **/app/backend/realtime_cv/**
    -    (empty initialization file)
    -    (Pydantic models for CV events and frame data)
    -    (A placeholder engine class  for future logic)

The immediate next steps would have been to create the API endpoints in , integrate the service into , and then begin work on the separate data collection system. The implementation of this entire professional-grade combat sports computer vision platform is therefore in its very early stages and incomplete.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create the  file for the  service to expose the CV analysis functionality via API endpoints, and create a data collection system.
